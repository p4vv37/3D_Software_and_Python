 I cannot test this version of script at the moment. It was updated, just as others, but not tested yet.

## How to use:

 To run the script execute:
 python.ExecuteFile "path:\to\Script_3DSMax.py"
 in MAXScript Listener
 
 Script has PySide (QT) GUI. 
 It will ask user for a path to the directory with additional files that are required.
